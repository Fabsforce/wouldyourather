This application is a WOULD YOU RATHER game.
Once logged in, the user could answer question/poll created on his own or by other users.
Immediately after answering a question, the user could see his answer compare to others.
It's fun because the user could follow the users performance on a Leaderboard. The more you answer and create questions, the higher you get.

## Installation

Install the project dependencies in running in your console :

`% yarn install`

## Start the development server with

`% yarn start`

## Important
The backend API contains 'static' results. It means that the backend contains initial data, that can be modify while using the app but will eventually get back to the initial state when the user refresh the page. In the future, I plan to add a real backend API.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

## Purpose
Some comments have not been removed; there are left there for education purpose, especially to explain some 'complex' javascript code and logic.
